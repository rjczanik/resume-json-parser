    "brief": "I am an experienced machine learning engineer who has worked on numerous data science solutions for multiple companies and clients.\n My main focus is providing end-to-end cloud-based solutions to clients. This all is done by doing all the work needed for conceptualizing, developing, and productization of a machine learning solution. I also have the certifications to back up my skillset: MLOps, data science, data engineering, and full-stack cloud development. My background is in open-source technologies, mainly on the Linux-tech stack. Of these technologies I the am strongest in RDMS, Python, R, ETL and the development of data science use cases as web-apps. \n My most recent experience lies in working as an MLOps engineer, where data science use cases are developed to completion and put into a production state.\n I am also a strong leader with a strategic and entrepreneurial mindset; Enabling me to have also led teams in building solutions using Agile and Scrum. As a strong communicator I had no challenge in regular engagements with stakeholders, technical teams, and the delivery team. Which also requires me to listen to all parties involved and to understand the problem holisticaly. This is done by creating a lateral understanding of a problem and develop the best outcome, and elegant solution for any client."
